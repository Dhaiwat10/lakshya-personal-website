I'm currently a Software Engineer at Bain & Company. Previously, I built LLM-powered solutions as an AI Engineer in the education sector, and before that, I developed data-driven strategies for private equity clients at Bain.

Outside of work, you'll find me chasing high scores in [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/) or experimenting in the kitchen as I learn to cook - because, why not?

If you have an interesting project that you want to build with me, or ideas to explore together, I'd love to [chat](mailto:${EMAIL}?subject=Hello%20from%20your%20website!)!`;
