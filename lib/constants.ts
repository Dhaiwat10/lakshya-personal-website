I'm currently working as AI Engineer, building LLM-based systems for the education industry. Previously, I spent time at Bain & Company, crunching numbers for private equity.

Outside of work, you'll find me optimizing assembly lines in Factorio (after years of Counter-Strike), capturing landscapes across countries with my phone, or struggling to learn Mandarin - because, why not?

If you have an interesting project that you want to build with me, or ideas to explore together, I’d love to [chat](mailto:${EMAIL}?subject=Hello%20from%20your%20website!)!`;
