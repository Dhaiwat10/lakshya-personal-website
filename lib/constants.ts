I'm currently on a break, touching grass. Previously, I worked as an AI Engineer, designing and deploying LLM-powered solutions for the education sector. Before that, I was at Bain & Company, where I analyzed data and developed strategies for private equity clients.

Outside of work, you'll find me building transit lines in [Cities: Skylines](https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/) (after years of Counter-Strike), capturing landscapes across countries with my phone, or struggling to learn Mandarin - because, why not?

If you have an interesting project that you want to build with me, or ideas to explore together, I’d love to [chat](mailto:${EMAIL}?subject=Hello%20from%20your%20website!)!`;
