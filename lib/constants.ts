I'm currently working as AI Engineer, building LLM-based systems for the education industry. Previously, I spent time at Bain & Company, crunching numbers for private equity.

Outside of work, I love playing video games, travelling and clicking pictures, and learning new things.

If you have an interesting project that you want to build with me, or ideas to explore together, I’d love to [chat](mailto:${EMAIL}?subject=Hello%20from%20your%20website!)!`;
